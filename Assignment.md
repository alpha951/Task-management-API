Task Management API
Background:
You are working for a fictional tech startup called "TechCorp," which specializes in building innovative web applications. The company is currently developing a new project and needs a talented intern to assist in the backend development process.

Assignment Description:
Your task is to create a robust and feature-rich backend API for a task management application using the following technologies: Node.js and PostgreSQL. While the frontend development is not required for this assignment, you should design the API with the intention of supporting a future frontend application. The API should allow users to efficiently manage their tasks, collaborate with others, and stay organized. The design should prioritize functionality, performance, and scalability.

Requirements:
Backend (Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL):
- Set up a Node.js server to handle API requests.
- Assignment of Tasks to Users: In a task management application, it's essential to have user-specific tasks. So create users and then create tasks for those users.
- Database Migrations/Seeds: Your solution should include appropriate database migrations and seed data to set up the database schema and initial data (seed your db with a few users).
- Create RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks.
- Implement appropriate error handling and validation.
- Implement user-specific views for tasks, ensuring that users only see their assigned tasks.
- Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
- Include a task history feature, showing task changes and updates (optional).
Submission Guidelines:
Provide a comprehensive GitHub repository with clear instructions on setting up and running the backend application. Include a detailed README file describing the project's structure, setup instructions, and any additional notes. Ensure that your code is well-documented with clear code comments where necessary.

Evaluation Criteria:
Effective use of Node.js and PostgreSQL.
Proper implementation of CRUD operations on tasks.
Clean, well-structured, and well-documented code.
Correct implementation of all specified features and requirements.
Effective error handling and validation.
Note: You can use any additional/different libraries or frameworks if necessary, but make sure to justify your choices in the code or documentation.
